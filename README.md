# SQL CASE STUDY  - LEARNING JOURNEY

Hi guy

This case study provided an excellent opportunity to apply my newly acquired SQL knowledge and skills to real-world business problems. Despite being a beginner, I was able to successfully complete four out of eight case studies, demonstrating my ability to grasp and implement SQL concepts effectively. However, I recognize that there is still much to learn, and I am committed to further developing my SQL and database expertise.

I used Azure Data Studio as my primary tool for learning, practicing, and writing SQL queries to address these case study challenges. Having started my SQL journey just two months ago, I am now confident in my ability to formulate queries and extract valuable insights from data. While my current queries may not be fully optimized, I am actively working to improve my query writing skills to ensure they are both readable and efficient.

I believe this case study experience showcases my aptitude for tackling diverse SQL challenges and my proficiency in SQL query writing and problem-solving. I am eager to leverage these skills to contribute to a data-driven organization and am seeking a challenging DE,DA,BA,... position upon graduation.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm here to support your learning journey and provide guidance. (if easy :D)

Thank you for your seeing my profile and for being a part of this community.

Best wishes,

Truong Ngo
