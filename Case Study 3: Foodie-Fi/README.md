## Table Description <a class = 'anchor' id = 'table-description'></a>
### *Table 1: plans*
Customers can choose which plans to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign up.

Basic plan customers have limited access and can only stream their videos and is only available monthly at $9.90

Pro plan customers have no watch time limits and are able to download videos for offline viewing. Pro plans start at $19.90 a month or $199 for an annual subscription.

Customers can sign up to an initial 7 day free trial will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during the trial.

When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service - they will have a churn plan record with a null price but their plan will continue until the end of the billing period.

### *Table 2: subscriptions*
Customer subscriptions show the exact date where their specific plan_id starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the start_date in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.

When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan - the higher plan will take effect straightaway.

When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period but the start_date will be technically the day they decided to cancel their service.

## Case Study Question & Solutions <a class = 'anchor' id = 'question-solutions'></a>
### A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
```c
SELECT s.customer_id , s.plan_id, p.plan_name, p.price, s.start_day
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p 
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE customer_id <= 8
```

***Key Finding:***

Almost customer entries with trial plan because it free and customer want to try some feature, user experience and everything make application helpful in future befrore customer consider to upgrade their plan up to next level

A trial plan give customer can try application for free in 7 days after that customer can choose a plan to upgrade for continue using service and it require charge for each month

Several customer always choose basic montly plan after using trial plan service and it require 9.90$ charge per month

**11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?**
```c
WITH pro_temp
AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id,s.start_day as pro_monthly_start_date
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE plan_name = 'pro monthly'
),
basic_temp
AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id,s.start_day as basic_monthly_start_date
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE plan_name = 'basic monthly'
)

SELECT *
FROM pro_temp p 
JOIN basic_temp b
ON p.customer_id = b.customer_id
WHERE p.pro_monthly_start_date < basic_monthly_start_date
```
***In Fact: No one downgrade from pro monthly plan to basic monthly plan***
