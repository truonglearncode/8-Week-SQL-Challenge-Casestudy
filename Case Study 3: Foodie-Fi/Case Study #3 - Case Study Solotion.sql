-- A. Customer Journey

-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-- Almost customer entries with trial plan because it free and customer want to try some feature, user experience and everything make application helpful in future befrore customer consider to upgrade their plan up to next level
-- A trial plan give customer can try application for free in 7 days after that customer can choose a plan to upgrade for continue using service and it require charge for each month
